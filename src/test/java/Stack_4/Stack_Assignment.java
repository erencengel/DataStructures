     * Given an array of buildings and a direction that all of the buildings face,
     * return an array of the indices of the buildings that can see the sunset.
     * A building can see the sunset if it's strictly taller than all of the buildings that come after it in the direction that it faces.
     * The input array named buildings contains positive, non-zero integers representing the heights of the buildings.
     * A building at index i thus has a height denoted by buildings[i] .
     * All of the buildings face the same direction, and this direction is either east or west,
     * denoted by the input string named direction , which will always be equal to either "EAST" or "WEST" .
     * In relation to the input array, you can interpret these directions as right for east and left for west.
     * Important note: the indices in the output array should be sorted in ascending order.
     * Sample Input buildings = [3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2] direction = "EAST"
     * Sample Output [1, 3, 6, 7] //
